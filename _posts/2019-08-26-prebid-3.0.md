## Prebid.js 3.0 major release announcement

The Prebid core team is working on a major release for 3.0. The main items to be included in this release currently:

* Upgrade all bidder adapters to HTTPS all the time. 
* Misc legacy APIs and functions (should be a minor publisher impact) -  [see here](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/4118)
* Tentative: Update to size config feature (Some breaking changes in behavior that publisher will want to review)
  
### Bidder compliance with 3.0

We ask all bidder adapters to ensure they are compliant with secure requests to their endpoints (HTTPS) since it is already a requirement for bidders to support it on secure pages this should hopefully not be a big issue. The prebid core team will automatically update all the endpoints to secure if they are not already for the 3.0 release. 

**Referrer detection and related code**

Bidder adapters should review their implementation to see if they are relying on getting referrer information from updated APIs in `utils.js` and instead use the new [referrer methods](http://prebid.org/dev-docs/bidder-adaptor.html#referrers) on the bid request (`bidderRequest.refererInfo`).

### Size Mapping feature
TBD

### Target release date
Q4 2019 (to be refined as scope is finalized)
